# variables you can set on host:

# enable_sshd=True (default False)
# Setting to True means sshd is started and the firewall is opened for port 22
# 
# expose_https=True (default False)
# Setting this to True means that the webserver starts listening on all interfaces
# on port 443 and the firewall is opened for it. If it is set to False it the
# webserver only listens on the localhost interface on port 80. No https.
